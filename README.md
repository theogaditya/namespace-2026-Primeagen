### 🔍 Verification Log (Admin/User FE missing)
- **Frontends (`user-fe`, `admin-fe`)**: These services do not have K8s manifests in `packages/k8s/` and their DNS records are not propagated. They are likely intended to be deployed separately (Vercel/Netlify) or are missing configuration.
- **Backends**: All backend services are **reachable** and returning healthy status.

## How to Access

- All services are exposed via **Traefik Ingress Controller**
- DNS records for backends connect to Traefik Load Balancer (`34.133.x.x`)
